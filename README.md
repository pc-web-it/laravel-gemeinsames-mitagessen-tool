<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/pc-web-it/laravel-gemeinsames-mitagessen-tool.git)

### Gemeinsames Mittagessen Tool

The "Gemeinsames Mittagessen Tool" is designed to facilitate the organization of monthly lunch meetings within a company. The main feature of the project is to randomly select two employees from a stored list: one employee to cook and another to present at the monthly meeting. This helps in engaging employees and promoting teamwork and interaction.

### Key Features

1. **Employee Selection for Monthly Meetings**:
   - Randomly selects one employee to cook and another to present at the monthly lunch meeting from the list of employees.

2. **Lucky Wheel**:
   - A fun "lucky wheel" feature allows for selecting "x" number of winners from a list of names imported in .csv format. This can be used for various purposes such as raffles, prize distributions, or any other random selection needs.

3. **Recipe Management**:
   - Maintains a list of recipes associated with each monthly meeting. This feature allows employees to view and share recipes, fostering a culture of sharing and collaboration.

### How It Works

- **Employee Selection**:
  - The tool ensures that the same employee is not chosen for both cooking and presenting unless there are insufficient employees available. It also handles cases where there are not enough employees to make a selection by providing appropriate feedback.

- **Lucky Wheel**:
  - Users can import a list of names from a .csv file and use the "lucky wheel" to randomly select winners. This adds an element of excitement and fun to the process of random selection.

- **Recipe Listing**:
  - Recipes can be added, viewed, and managed for each meeting. This helps in documenting and sharing culinary ideas among employees.

The "Gemeinsames Mittagessen Tool" aims to enhance employee interaction and engagement through organized and enjoyable monthly meetings, while also providing additional features that can be used for various other purposes within the organization.
